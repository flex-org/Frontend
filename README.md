steps to making branch and push to the main

1- you are in the branch now? good, write this => "git add ." then => "git commit -m "i finished""
2- if you have not pull any changes, go to the main and make sure you pulled the last changes => "git checkout main" then => "git pull"
3- back to the branch to push by writing => "git checkout 'branch name'" then => "git push origin 'branch name'"
4- back to main by => "git checkout main" then pull the changes you made
